                  <h1>Phil Richards</h1>
                  <h2>Owner & Pitmaster</h2>
                  <p>
                     Phil was born and raised in Maryville, IL, and attended Collinsville High School.
                     While there, he set numerous track-and-field records, some of which still stand today!
                     He soon moved to Texas with his wife Jody and got his first taste of some good ol' Texas
                     Barbecue. Years later, they moved back to Illinois to be closer to family, and Phil bought 
                     an old trailer and converted it into a BBQ trailer, and would sell his smoked meats from the trailer
                     while parked out in the lot of ATVs and More in Salem IL.
                     His BBQ became so popular in town that he was able to quit his day job and open the restaurant 
                     in his hometown of Iuka. <br />
                     When he isn't hard at work smoking hundreds of pounds of meat, you can find Phil working on his boat,
                     fishing, or spending time with his grandsons.

                  <h2>Taste Tester</h2>
                  <p>
                     Anthony is Phil's oldest grandson. <br />
                     He is 4 years old and attending preschool in his hometown of St. Louis MO.<br />
                     Nothing makes it onto the menu without his stamp of approval!<br />
                     When Anthony isn't sampling some of Grampa's cooking, he's usually playing with his 
                     monster trucks or talking someone's ears off...
